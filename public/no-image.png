Create a placeholder image file for missing images

Unfortunately, I cannot directly create binary image files in this environment. However, you can create a placeholder image manually by downloading a free "No Image Available" placeholder from the internet or creating one using an image editor.

### Steps to Add the Placeholder Image:
1. Download a placeholder image (e.g., from [this link](https://via.placeholder.com/300x450?text=No+Image)).
2. Save the image as `no-image.png`.
3. Place the file in the `RetroMovie_App-main/public` directory.

Once you've added the image, the fallback mechanism in the `Card` component should work as expected. Let me know if you need further assistance!
